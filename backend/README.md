# SuRaksha — Real-Time Fraud Detection System

A production-grade, full-stack fraud detection platform that detects anomalous banking transactions in real time using unsupervised machine learning, explainable AI, and automated regulatory compliance tooling.

**API:** http://3.6.98.160:8000/docs  
**Developed by:** Abhishek Shandilya — VIT Bhopal University

## What It Does

SuRaksha monitors banking transactions in real time. When a transaction arrives, it is scored against a behavioral baseline learned from the user's historical activity. Anomalous transactions are automatically flagged, explained, and actioned — all within milliseconds.

The system does not use static rules. It learns what normal looks like for each individual user and flags deviations — catching fraud that rule-based systems miss.

Feature Engineering (15 behavioral features)
↓
Isolation Forest Model (ROC-AUC: 0.9826)

## Model Validation

| Dataset | Transactions | ROC-AUC |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Synthetic Indian Banking Data | 78,299 | 0.9826 |
| Kaggle Credit Card Fraud (real, unseen) | 284,807 | 0.9016 |

The model was trained on synthetic data and validated on 284,807 real European credit card transactions without retraining — confirming that the behavioral feature engineering captures universal fraud signals.
